# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write the following method for the Graph class:

* breadth first
* Arguments: Node
* Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
* Display the collection

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
![graph breadth first](../../../../assets/graphbreadthfirst.jpeg)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Using a while loop to iterate over each element in the graph. and using a set and list to hole the results.
Time Complexity: O(n) because we are using set and the set search time is O(1).
Space Complexity: O(n)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
1. Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
2. Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
3. Dequeue the first node from the queue
4. if the Dequeueâ€˜d node has unvisited child nodes, add the unvisited children to visited set and insert them into the queue.

```javascript

ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;

```
